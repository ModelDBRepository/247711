Example Figure 7AB:<p/>

Open the model file in opencor. Change the ending point to 4000
  sec. Create one extra graph (click + sign).  Right-click "a" in "a"
  list (select Plot against then click "s" -> "s"). Select the other
  graph and add one at a time "a" and then "s" selecting in each case
  to Plot against the integration variable. Finally run each (click
  upper left play triangle) to create the following graphs similar to
  fig 7AB although the noise current is absent in the model:<p/>
